<h1 align="center">How URLs work?</h1>

"[How URLs work?](https://howurls.work)" is an educational website that explains the counterparts of a URL by visually inspecting them.

## History

When trying to explain a URL structure to one of my students, I've realized that it would be much easier to go through each chunk of a URL visually. This is how this project came to be.
